# NEAR Intents TEE Solver Registry with 1inch Integration

The NEAR Intents TEE Solver Registry is a protocol that enables secure and private execution of NEAR Intents solvers using Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology. This project includes a complete 1inch protocol implementation (Limit Order Protocol and Cross-chain Escrow) integrated with NEAR Intents for cross-chain atomic swaps.

This protocol allows liquidity pools creation for NEAR Intents. Liquidity providers can transfer funds into the pools' smart contracts. Only the solvers who're running within TEE with the approved Docker images can be registered and authorized to operate against the pools' assets.

## üöÄ 1inch Implementation Features

- **Limit Order Protocol**: Complete NEAR implementation of 1inch's limit order functionality
- **Cross-chain Escrow**: Atomic swap mechanism for NEAR ‚Üî EVM chains
- **TypeScript SDK**: Full client-side library with type safety
- **Docker Build System**: Cross-platform compilation for Apple Silicon and x86_64
- **Automated Deployment**: Scripts for NEAR testnet and EVM testnet deployment
- **Comprehensive Testing**: End-to-end testing framework

## Overview

The system consists of several main components:

1. **Smart Contracts**
   - `solver-registry`: Support liquidity pools creation. Manage registration and verification of TEE solvers for each liquidity pool.
   - `intents-vault`: The vault contract that manage the pool's asset within NEAR Intents.
   - `limit-order-protocol`: 1inch Limit Order Protocol implementation for NEAR
   - `cross-chain-escrow`: Cross-chain atomic swap escrow contract

2. **Solver Management Server**
   - A TypeScript-based server that manages the lifecycle of TEE solvers
   - Handles solver deployment and monitoring for each liquidity pool

3. **TypeScript SDK**
   - Client-side library for interacting with all contracts
   - Full type safety and comprehensive error handling

## Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo (latest stable version)
- Node.js (v20 or later)
- pnpm package manager
- Docker and Docker Compose
- NEAR CLI
- A NEAR account with sufficient NEAR tokens for funding the ephemeral accounts in each TEE solver

## üê≥ Docker Compilation Setup

### Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Users

Due to WASM compilation issues on Apple Silicon, we use Docker for consistent builds:

```bash
# Build all contracts using Docker
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/code -w /code --platform=linux/amd64 rust:1.86.0 bash -c "
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown && 
cargo clean && 
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release -p limit-order-protocol &&
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release -p cross-chain-escrow &&
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release -p solver-registry
"
```

### x86_64 Users

```bash
# Standard compilation
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

### Build Individual Contracts

```bash
# Build Limit Order Protocol
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/code -w /code --platform=linux/amd64 rust:1.86.0 bash -c "
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown && 
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release -p limit-order-protocol
"

# Build Cross-chain Escrow
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/code -w /code --platform=linux/amd64 rust:1.86.0 bash -c "
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown && 
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release -p cross-chain-escrow
"
```

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### 1. NEAR Testnet Deployment

#### Create NEAR Account

```bash
# Create a new NEAR account
near create-account <your-account>.testnet --masterAccount <master-account>.testnet

# Or use existing account
near login
```

#### Deploy Contracts

```bash
# Deploy Limit Order Protocol
near deploy <your-account>.testnet target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/limit_order_protocol.wasm

# Initialize the contract
near call <your-account>.testnet new '{"owner_id": "<your-account>.testnet"}' --accountId <your-account>.testnet

# Deploy Cross-chain Escrow
near deploy <your-account>.testnet target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cross_chain_escrow.wasm

# Initialize the contract

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues and Solutions

### 1. NEAR SDK Deserialization Error

**Error**: `CompilationError(PrepareError(Deserialization))`

**Description**: This error occurs during contract initialization on NEAR testnet, affecting all contracts including known-working ones.

**Root Cause**: NEAR SDK v5.14.0 compatibility issue with testnet RPC.

**Solutions**:
- Try downgrading to NEAR SDK v4.x
- Use different RPC endpoints
- Test with mainnet deployment
- Check NEAR CLI version compatibility

**Status**: Under investigation - affects all contracts, not just 1inch implementation.

### 2. Apple Silicon WASM Compilation

**Error**: `relocation R_WASM_MEMORY_ADDR_SLEB cannot be used against symbol ... recompile with -fPIC`

**Description**: WASM cross-compilation fails on Apple Silicon due to architecture differences.

**Solution**: Use Docker compilation (see Docker Compilation Setup above).

### 3. Cargo Lock File Version

**Error**: `error: failed to parse lock file at: /code/Cargo.lock lock file version '4' was found, but this version of Cargo does not understand this lock file`

**Description**: Docker image has outdated Cargo version.

**Solution**: Use `rust:1.86.0` Docker image (already specified in commands above).

### 4. Node Modules Tracking

**Issue**: `node_modules` directory being tracked in git.

**Solution**: Updated `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts and dependencies.

  takingAmount: '2000000000000000000000000', // 2 tokens
  expiration: Date.now() + 3600000 // 1 hour
});
```

### Create Cross-chain Escrow

```javascript
const escrowId = await escrow.createEscrow({
  makerAsset: 'token-a.testnet',
